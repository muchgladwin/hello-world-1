Overall plan (simple):

1. Create an Object that represents a person. 
This should be in a class called something like Person.java and introduces you to the idea of an object.

2. Give the Person object some characteristics that are typically associated with a person.
Also give the person object some methods that represent things that a person might do, or that might happen to a person.
See "plan/Person".
This introduces the idea of variable and types. Make sure to include a few different types, including primitives and String.

3. In the main method, create an instance of a person. This introduces instantition of an object.
We will instantiate a few people, probably one each so we can experiment.

4. In the main method, call some non-static methods on person. Introduce the difference between non-static and static.

5. In the main method, print out some information from the instances of person taht we created.

6. Refactor the main method to introduce cleaner coding and comments, use of methods for organisation.

7. Refactor the code to use an array of people. This introduces arrays.
