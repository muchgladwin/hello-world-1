I'm going to propose a project that we can work on to build up some basics in practise.
We will start simple and flesh this out as we go (this is agile programming...we don't actually know 100% what we are going to do yet, so we will make the basics work well and be adaptable).

Summary:
Describe a day in the life of a person.

Who are we?
A deity.

Conditions of satisfaction:
1. At the start of the day we need to describe our person.
2. We need to be able to make the person do activities of our choice.
3. At the end of the day we need to hear all about it.

Things we can learn about:

Variables
Methods
Objects
