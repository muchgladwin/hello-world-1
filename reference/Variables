Variables are what we call bits of information that we make, use, pass around the code, store data in, etc.

A variable has three main properties:
1. Type - This describes the kind of data that is held by the variable.
2. Name - This is how we refer to the variable
3. Value - This is the value of the data that is held by the variable.

We create an instance of a variable by defining these three properties like so:

Type Name = value
int myNumber = 1;
String yourString = "hello";

In these examples, int and String are the types.
int represents an integer number. String is an object that represents text.
Other examples of types which you can look up are char, boolean, float, double.

In the examples, myNumber and yourString are the names. You can call things whatever you want but there are some rules.
You cannot call two things the same name if they are within the saem scope (we can discuss scope in more depth later).
By convention, we name things in camel case - numberThatRepresentsHeight is a suitably terribly named variable that 
demonstrates camel case. A better choice would simply be height.

In the examples, the values are 1 and "hello". Some types can take raw input, such as int. 
Some types such as String, require some boundaries. For a string, the boundaries are double quotes.
